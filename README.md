# sparkle-survey-form
A whimsical survey form I created to build my new HTML and CSS skills.

This Sparkle Survey Form was created as part of the Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp. It does not yet submit results to a database, but it might do in future.  
I was very pleased to test out my new HTML and CSS skills and to push them further to get my form to look the way I wanted it to, using rules like `fieldset > *:not(legend)`.  
Here is a link to the form: https://aashni23.github.io/sparkle-survey-form/
